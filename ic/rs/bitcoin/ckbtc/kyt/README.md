# Experimental KYT Canister 

This package contains an experimental canister implementing Know Your Transaction (KYT) service using [Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/) as the underlying service provider.

The purpose of this canister is to explore whether it's possible to integrate KYT into the ckBTC minter flows using HTTP outcalls.
